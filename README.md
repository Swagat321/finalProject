# Stor390 Final Paper: Adolescent Suicide Risk Prediction Using Classification Trees

This repository contains the source code and documents related to a final project evaluating the use of Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) to identify adolescents at risk for suicide ideation. The project is based on the findings of Hill, Oosterhoff, and Kaplow (2017), who employed CTA to categorize adolescents into risk strata using psychosocial and behavioral indicators.

The work here continues from an initial midterm paper and culminates in a final paper presented in R Markdown (.Rmd) and PDF knitted format. The final analysis integrates statistical considerations, a simulation study verifying the method’s performance, and a normative framework (particularly Rawls’ theory of justice) to address the moral implications of misclassification.

## Key Takeaways
#### Statistical Insight:
The classification tree approach can balance sensitivity and specificity, offering interpretable rules for identifying at-risk adolescents.

#### Ethical Considerations:
Grounding the analysis in Rawlsian and other moral frameworks highlights that minimizing false negatives is ethically imperative to protect the most vulnerable. However, the project also acknowledges the real consequences of false positives, from stigmatization to resource misallocation.

#### Practical Application:
The final paper underscores the complexity of implementing CTA in real-world settings—decision-makers must weigh not only performance metrics but also the moral implications and operational constraints (like limited counseling staff).
